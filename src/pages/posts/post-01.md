## Picking a Distro!
Nearly any of these would have worked eventually, but I focused on "out of the box", gaming-ready, cleanliness, and how smooth it felt. It is true that you can create a very similar experience with many options, especially since a huge portion of them are ultimately Debian-based!

1. **Pop!_OS**: Other than being annoying to type/search ("PopOS" works), this emerged as my clear favorite.<br>Based on Ubuntu, custom desktop based on GNOME, focused on being clean and easy to use and as a gaming desktop. Developed by System76, a PC builder, so it's designed to work on gaming hardware, including nvidia. Pop hands-down has the best remote desktop interface, and they seem very active on updates and support.<br>Just plain felt the best all around, with no negatives to criticize. Occasionally had to search for tweaks.

2. **Linux Mint**: Close second pick. Likely to be most commonly recommended online by general public.<br>Also based on Ubuntu, Cinnamon desktop which looks like Windows 7, made for beginners and ease of use.<br>It looked _too much_ like Windows for me, when the whole point was to leave!<br>Not as bad as others, but felt a little bloaty with lots of pre-installs that I removed.<br>Cinnamon is a crowd favorite, but it didn't grab me. Menus & system settings weren't as smooth to go through, etc. They also change "default Linux" locations for setups/configs, so searching online you often need to find Mint-specific answers.

3. **Ubuntu**: Corporate-backed building block of many distro options. Unfortunately also its downfall.<br>Bloaty, bulky, with lots of software installed. Owner seems to be pushing for proprietary app installers.<br>Still fair to recognize that these first 3 are all Ubuntu-based, and still gave similar results overall.<br>Ubuntu, also, is based on Debian further making the upstream chain.

4. **Debian**: Upstream to Ubuntu (and many others), foundational to GNU/Linux ecosystem.<br>Very clean and customizable, almost to a negative for beginners/newcomers.<br>Still, my Raspberry Pis run a version of Debian, and my home server will likely be Debian too.<br>Fully recommend for servers and headless functions, or if you are experienced, but not as your daily desktop driver.

5. **Other Ubuntu-based**<br>
Any other Ubuntu-based will honestly give similar results to to each other
   - **Kubuntu**: Ubuntu, but with KDE desktop. KDE felt better than Cinnamon, but not Pop!_OS. Very customizable.
   - **Zorin**: Another Ubuntu based. They have a paid version, that they were kinda pushy to get.
   - **Elementary OS**: another one tried

6. **Non-Ubuntu-based**<br>
Online commenters will recommend these, and I'm sure they work for some.<br>
But they might have less support, and might need more tinkering for the more detailed desires. Or you need to constantly un-break updates, etc.
   - **Fedora based**: Didn't try, seems to have a strong following.
   - **SUSE based**: Same as Fedora. Didn't try, didn't seem beginner/gaming focused.

7. **Anything ARCH based**: Not for beginners, ignore online saying otherwise, requires more attention/knowledge. "rolling updates" means you have a higher chance of frequent updates breaking your setup. These people seem to brag about how often they have to fix it.

## What's next

Other than making sure my documents were backed up - nothing!<br>
During distro-testing I confirmed the few apps I used worked in Linux just fine. Between Ubuntu-based being easy to use, Steam making almost ANY game work - the time is now!
