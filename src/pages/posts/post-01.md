## Picking a Distro!
Nearly any of these would have worked eventually, but I focused on "out of the box", gaming-ready, cleanliness, and how smooth it felt. It is true that you can create a very similar experience with many options, especially since a huge portion of them are ultimately Debian-based!

1. **Pop!_OS**: Other than being annoying to type/search (PopOS works), this emerged as my clear favorite.<br>Based on Ubuntu, custom desktop based on GNOME, focused on being clean and easy to use.<br>Developed by System76, a PC builder, so it's designed to work on gaming hardware.<br>Just plain felt the best all around, with no negatives to criticize.

2. **Linux Mint**: Probably second pick. Likely to be most commonly recommended online.<br>Also based on Ubuntu, Cinnamon desktop which looks like Windows 7, made for beginners and ease of use.<br>It looked _too much_ like Windows for me, when the whole point was to leave!<br>Not as bad as others, but also felt bloaty with lots of pre-installs.<br>Cinnamon is a crowd favorite, but it didn't grab me. Menus & system settings weren't as smooth to go through, etc.

3. **Ubuntu**: Corporate-backed building block of many distro options. Unfortunately part of its issue.<br>Bloaty, bulky, with lots of software installed. Owner seems to be pushing for proprietary app installers.<br>Still fair to recognize that these first 3 are all Ubuntu-based, and still gave similar results overall.<br>Ubuntu, also, is based on Debian further making the upstream chain.

4. **Debian**: Upstream to Ubuntu (and many others), foundational to GNU/Linux ecosystem.<br>Very clean and customizable, almost to a negative for beginners/newcomers like me.<br>Still, my Raspberry Pis run a version of Debian, and my home server will likely be Debian (xfce destop) too.<br>Fully recommend for servers and headless functions, but not as your daily desktop driver.

5. **Kubuntu**: Ubuntu, but with KDE desktop. KDE felt better than Cinnamon, but not Pop!_OS
6. **Zorin**: Another Ubuntu based. They have a paid version, and again just didn't grab me.
7. **Fedora based**: Didn't try, seems to have a strong following, but still not as "easy" or gaming-made.
8. **SUSE based**: Same as Fedora. Didn't try, didn't seem beginner/gaming focused.
9. **Anything ARCH based**: Not for beginners, ignore online saying otherwise.

## What's next

Other than making sure my documents were backed up - nothing!<br>
During distro-testing I confirmed the fiew apps I used worked in Linux just fine.
